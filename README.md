# Analysis-and-Design
A repository showcasing some of the work done in the CS-300 Analysis and Design course

Throughout this course, we worked to solve the difficulties of algorithms and data structures. I learned to approach these difficulties with a calm approach, which allowed me to sort out desired functionalities into different sections. This allowed me to overcome any roadblocks by quarantining the problem until I obtained the desired functionality. This system that I used above to work through this class has expanded my process in software development.
